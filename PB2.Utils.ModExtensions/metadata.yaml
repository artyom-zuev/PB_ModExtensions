  This is a library mod modifying game code to fix bugs and limitations. It will not introduce significant changes to your game when installed separately, but might be required as a dependency by other mods.



  Will be updated in sync with official releases: if a bug or limitation covered by this mod ends up being addressed in a future Phantom Brigade release, this mod will be adjusted accordingly. Some of the fixes:


  - Patched overworld sidebar UI to prevent overflow with a high number of highlighted missions.

  - Fixed given pilot names added by mods not appearing in random generation.

  - Fixed clamped part rating in unit generation preventing modding of higher rarities.

  - Fixed the internal spawn menu not selecting higher rarities.

Feel free to use this mod as a dependency or a reference the project setup and source code when developing your own library mods.
