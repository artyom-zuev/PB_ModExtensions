desc: "This is a library mod patching the game to fix bugs and limitations related to modding. It will not introduce significant changes to your game when installed separately, but might be required as a dependency by other mods. ModExtensions is an unofficial and experimental project and is not intended to replace official updates. If a bug or limitation covered by this mod ends up being addressed in an official update, ModExtensions will be updated accordingly. \n\nPlease remember that mods are installed at your own risk and that modded campaigns are not officially supported. This is not an official BYG release. Some of the fixes:\n\n- Patched overworld sidebar UI to prevent overflow with a high number of highlighted missions.\n- Fixed given pilot names added by mods not appearing in random generation.\n- Fixed clamped part rating in unit generation preventing modding of higher rarities.\n- Fixed the internal spawn menu not selecting higher rarities.\n- Added support for sideloading pooled VFX, props and area background assets.\n- Adjusted sideloading of item visuals, removing asset bundle names from registered keys ('bundle/prefab_name' turns to 'prefab_name') to fix pooling issues, allow replacing built in visuals and improve compatibility with SDK utilities. The original key format (`bundle/prefab_name`) will remain recognized by the game.\n- Fixed inventory previews failing to return sideloaded item visuals back to pools.\n- Fixed mechs and inventory previews using wrong indexes for attachments.\n- Fixed mechs and inventory previews failing to hide base body models for attachments.\n\nSource code available on [url=https://github.com/artyom-zuev/PB_ModExtensions][u]GitHub[/u][/url]. Feel free to use this mod as a dependency or a reference the project setup and source code when developing your own library mods.
