  This is a library mod modifying game code to fix bugs and limitations. It will not introduce significant changes to your game when installed separately, but might be required as a dependency by other mods.


  Will be updated in sync with official releases: if a bug or limitation covered by this mod ends up being addressed in a future Phantom Brigade release, this mod will be adjusted accordingly. Some of the fixes:


  - Patched overworld sidebar UI to prevent overflow with a high number of highlighted missions.

  - Fixed given pilot names added by mods not appearing in random generation.

  - Fixed clamped part rating in unit generation preventing modding of higher rarities.

  - Fixed the internal spawn menu not selecting higher rarities.

  - Added support for sideloading pooled VFX, props and area background assets.

  - Adjusted sideloading of item visuals, removing asset bundle names from registered keys ('bundle/prefab_name' turns to 'prefab_name') to fix pooling issues, allow replacing built in visuals and improve compatibility with SDK utilities. The original key format (`bundle/prefab_name`) will remain recognized by the game.

  - Fixed inventory previews failing to return sideloaded item visuals back to pools.

  - Fixed mechs and inventory previews using wrong indexes for attachments.

  - Fixed mechs and inventory previews failing to hide base body models for attachments.
