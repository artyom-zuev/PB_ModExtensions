  This is a library mod modifying game code to fix bugs and limitations. Will be updated in sync with official releases: if a bug or limitation covered by this mod ends up being addressed in a future Phantom Brigade release, this mod will be adjusted accordingly. Some of the fixes:


  - Patched overworld sidebar UI to prevent overflow with a high number of highlighted missions.

  - Fixed given pilot names added by mods not appearing in random generation.

  - Fixed clamped part rating in unit generation preventing modding of higher rarities.

  - Fixed the internal spawn menu not selecting higher rarities.
