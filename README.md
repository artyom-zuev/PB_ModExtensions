# PB_ModExtensions
ModExtensions is a library mod for Phantom Brigade that patches issues interfering with certain mods.

  - Patches some overworld UI to improve mission display in custom campaigns.
  - Fixes modded given pilot names not appearing in random generation.
  - Fixes clamped part rating in unit generation preventing modding of higher rarities.
